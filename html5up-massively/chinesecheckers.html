                  <!-- Placeholder Image with Description -->
                  <h4>Board Setup and Game Initialization</h4>
                  <div class="image-container">
                      <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chinesecheckers1.png" alt="" /></a>
                      <p class="image-description">The BoardModel class manages the game's board and rules for Chinese Checkers, handling game setup, player pieces, and movement logic. It defines the board dimensions and initial piece positions based on the number of players. Upon starting the game, it sets up the board with pieces in their starting positions and handles invalid/empty positions. It also includes methods to handle difficulty settings and piece placement.</p>

                  <!-- Another Placeholder Image with Description -->
                  <h4>Game Logic and Piece Movement</h4>
                  <div class="image-container">
                      <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chinesecheckers2.png" alt="" /></a>
                      <p class="image-description">The class implements piece movement and legal move validation using methods such as PieceMove and LegalMove. It checks if a move is valid based on the piece’s position and available directions. The piece's position is updated on the board, and listeners are notified of the move. Additionally, jump moves and regular moves are handled separately with methods like FindJumpDirection and FindMoveDirection.</p>
                  </div>
  
                   <!-- Another Placeholder Image with Description -->
                   <h4>Player Actions and AI Moves</h4>
                   <div class="image-container">
                      <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chinesecheckers3.png" alt="" /></a>
                      <p class="image-description">The game supports both human and AI players. The AI’s moves are calculated using the Minimax algorithm, determining the best possible move based on the current game state and difficulty setting. The PlaceMove method compares the AI's board state to the human player's and updates the board accordingly. The AI moves are displayed through listeners, and the game checks for winning conditions after every move.</p>
                  </div>

                  <h4>Game Saving and Loading</h4>
                   <div class="image-container">
                      <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chinesecheckers4.png" alt="" /></a>
                      <p class="image-description">The SaveGame method allows the current game state to be serialized and stored for later use. The game’s state, including the board layout, number of players, and difficulty level, is saved in a file. The class also defines a LoadGame method (currently unimplemented) to load a saved game state and restore progress. This feature enables players to pause and continue games as desired.

                        This structure encapsulates the core mechanics of Chinese Checkers, including game setup, piece movement, AI decision-making, and game persistence, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience.</p>
